  <h1>TO ELSAR THE KEEPER OF MY HEART</h1>
  <div class="poem">
    In the cold darkness of the distance, where shadows of loneliness play, My heart beats and pleads for you.
    With every breath I take, my love grows stronger as I wait for you.
    With every second I live our memories held within keep me alive and warm in the cold.
    Your hugs and cuddles shield me from the heavy weight of daily stress, you are my Salvation.
    I love you babe❤️😍.<br><br>
    Your name Ruth, an assurances of loyalty.
    Elsperanza, you give me hope... Our love, future and a happy family.
